# Parity Gap Summary

## Strongly Implemented
- Core data spine: workspace, sidecar, SQLite, legacy import, marks grid.
- Students, attendance, seating, notes, learning skills, loaned items, device mappings.
- Comments/banks baseline workflows.
- Reports export pipeline and major report models.
- Backup/exchange baseline and packaged smoke checks.

## Largest Remaining Gaps
1. Interactive analytics screen parity (class/student/combined reports).
2. Planner and course description module parity.
3. Transfer-mode and advanced comments communication parity.
4. Setup subdomain parity breadth.
5. Chapter-13 integration breadth beyond current exchange/SIS lane.

## Priority Direction
- Core-first classroom workflows and analytics before planner and peripheral integrations.
