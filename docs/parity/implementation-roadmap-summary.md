# Implementation Roadmap Summary

## Wave Order
1. Classroom workflow closure.
2. Analytics/report interactive parity.
3. Comments/transfer parity.
4. Planner/course description.
5. Setup/admin parity breadth.
6. Integration parity hardening.
7. Visual/discoverability parity pass.

## Program Guarantees
- No security-boundary regressions.
- No IPC breaking changes unless versioned.
- Every wave ships with Rust + Playwright + parity gate updates.
