"Despite a generally satisfactory effort on his part, Tam has experienced considerable difficulty in Mathematics this term. His knowledge of basic facts and operations requires attention. Weakness here will have an adverse affect on all other areas in the program. When new concepts are presented, Tam is encouraged to pay close attention in class and to complete homework with care. He needs to check his work with his classmates or a calculator on a regular basis. He is encouraged to persevere in his efforts to apply these ideas accurately and to actively seek assistance."

"Gerry has experienced considerable difficulty in Mathematics this term. His knowledge of basic facts and operations requires attention. Weakness here will have an adverse affect on all other areas in the program. When new concepts are presented, Gerry is encouraged to pay close attention in class and to complete homework with care. He needs to check his work with his classmates or a calculator on a regular basis. He is encouraged to persevere in his efforts improve his basic skills, to apply new concepts accurately, to complete all homework assignments and to actively seek assistance."
"Ken's progress in the Math program has been unsatisfactory. Most of the time he has shown understanding of the material covered but he has had some difficulty applying them with accuracy and considerable difficulty in completing assignments. A much more determined effort to pay attention in class, to complete homework assignments and to actively seek assistance is needed. Unless there is considerable improvement, Ken will not complete the math program with success."
"Shelley's progress this term has been generally satisfactory. She is usually able to apply basic facts and operations accurately in her assignments but further review and practice would be beneficial. Appropriate strategies to solve problems are usually selected but, at times, a more detailed analysis of the question and her options is needed. Shelley must show complete solutions in her work at all times. She is usually successful when applying the new concepts presented this term but she would benefit from more careful attention in class. Shelley is encouraged to complete all assignments with care and to seek assistance when needed."
"Daniella's effort and progress in Mathematics this term have, for the most part, been satisfactory. She is usually able to apply basic facts and operations accurately in assignments. In general, appropriate strategies are selected in problem solving situations and she usually shows complete solutions. Daniella has a good understanding of the new concepts presented this term and has completed most assignments with few, if any errors. She is encouraged to persevere in her efforts to apply new skills and concepts accurately and to seek assistance when needed."
