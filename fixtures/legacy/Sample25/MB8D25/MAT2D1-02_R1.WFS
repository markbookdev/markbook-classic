His level of achievement in some strands is unsatisfactory. Usually new concepts are understood and applied accurately only with a great deal of additional assistance. Assignments designed to reinforce these concepts need to be completed carefully on a regular basis. He seems reluctant to check his work for unnecessary errors. He must improve his knowledge of basic facts and operations. In order to complete a successful year in Mathematics, he is encouraged to be more persistent in resolving difficulties on his own and, when necessary, actively seek assistance."

His level of achievement is very unsatisfactory. Usually new concepts are understood but assignments are rarely completed and handed in. When they are, understanding is usually evident but the competence that comes with practice is weak. In class, he must concentrate on the task at hand and avoid wasting his time and the time of others. In order to complete a successful year in Mathematics, he must complete and hand in his work, he must be more persistent in resolving difficulties and, he must actively seek assistance. Ken is capable of much better results."
